## For Plug-n-Script owners ##

If you're a Plug-n-Script user, feel free to use, learn and edit this script for your needs.

For the graphics to work properly, you should add the contents of "PNS_Skin/LetiMix" folder to your Plug-n-Script Skin.


### On Windows ###
In my installation skin files are located here:

C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\BC Plug'n Script VST3 data\Skins

1. Copy **PNS_Skin/LetiMix** folder into that folder

2. Edit **default.xml** file and insert this:

    <INCLUDE_ONCE file="LetiMix/letimix-cmt.inc"/>

### On Mac ###

You should probably make a copy of your whole skin, and make changes to a copy. Then select this skin in plugin settings.
