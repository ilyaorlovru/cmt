# Plug-n-Script Skin Update #

For these CMT plugins to work properly you have to add custom graphics into your PnS Skin.

## Windows ##

In my installation skin files are located here:

C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\BC Plug'n Script VST3 data\Skins

1. Copy **LetiMix** folder into that folder 
2. Edit **default.xml** file and insert this:

    <INCLUDE_ONCE file="LetiMix/letimix-cmt.inc"/>
